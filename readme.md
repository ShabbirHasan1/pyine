# Pyine Dev

## Important Files
- main.py - run sample backtest & optimiser on example strategy (may not work any more without some tinkering)
- dashboard.py - loads web interface for optimiser and backtester
- /dist/ - contains all of the main engies, example indicators, strategies etc [engines probably need rewriting to improve performance]
